                        Some of the content that you see displayed on the Platform is not hosted by the Platform. These
                        “embeds” are hosted by a third-party and embedded in the Platform. These files send data to the
                        hosted site just as if you were visiting that site directly (for example, when you load a Platform
                        post page with a YouTube video embedded in it, YouTube receives data about your activity).

                        The Platform does not control what data third parties collect or what they will do with it. So, thirdparty embeds on the Platform are not covered by this Privacy Policy. They are covered by the
                        privacy policy of the third-party service.

                        <b>Sharing Information With Third Party Embeds</b>
                        <br>
                        Some embeds may ask you for Information, such as your email address, through a form. We do
                        our best to keep bad actors off of the Platform. However, if you choose to submit your Information
                        to a third party this way, we don’t know what they may do with it. As explained above, their actions
                        are not covered by this Privacy Policy. So, please be careful when you see embedded forms on the
                        Platform asking for your email address or any other Information. Make sure you understand who
                        you are submitting your Information to and what they say they plan to do with it. We suggest that
                        you do not submit Information to any third-party through an embedded form.
